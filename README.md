# Diabetes-EDA-Predictions
Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder, affects millions worldwide, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems and individual well-being. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, understanding its underlying patterns and predicting its occurrence becomes increasingly imperative.

This project delves into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to gain insights into diabetes. By harnessing the power of data, we aim to unravel hidden trends, identify risk factors, and ultimately develop predictive models that can assist in early detection and proactive management of this condition.
